# NSS Bug Patch Review

Review bug: $ARGUMENTS

Follow each phase below in order. Record the outcome of every step — both pass and fail — for the final summary.

---

## Phase 0: Locate the Diff

Search for the patch file. Check these locations in order:
1. `/tmp/bug$ARGUMENTS.diff`, `/tmp/bug-$ARGUMENTS.diff`, `/tmp/bug$ARGUMENTS.patch`
2. `~/Downloads/bug$ARGUMENTS.diff`, `~/Downloads/bug$ARGUMENTS.patch`
3. Any `.diff` or `.patch` file in `/tmp/` or `~/Downloads/` whose name contains `$ARGUMENTS`
4. The current working directory for any `.diff` or `.patch` file

If no diff is found, stop and ask the user where the patch file is located.

---

## Phase 1: Patch Analysis

Read the full diff. Identify and record:

- **Summary**: What does this patch do? What bug is it fixing?
- **Files changed**: List all modified source files with a brief note on what changed in each
- **Test files**: List any new or modified test files (paths containing `gtest`, `_test`, `tests/`)
- **Code areas touched**: Which NSS subsystems are affected? (TLS/SSL, PKI/cert, crypto, PKCS11, PKCS12, etc.)
- **Fuzz-relevant**: Are any of the changed areas covered by fuzzers in `nss/fuzz/targets/`? Map changed code to relevant fuzzer targets.
- **Coverage strategy**: Which gtest suites and test shell scripts are most relevant to the changed code?

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Patch Test Verification (Tests Must Fail)

This phase verifies that any new test cases in the patch actually test the bug being fixed.

**Only run this phase if the patch adds new gtest test cases.**

2a. Ensure the repo is on a clean baseline (no patch applied):
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
git stash list   # just to check state; do not discard anything
git status
```

2b. Build NSS (standard build):
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
./build.sh 2>&1 | tail -20
```

2c. For each new gtest test case identified in Phase 1, run it using the appropriate test script with `GTESTFILTER`. Use the pattern from CLAUDE.md — for ssl_gtest:
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss/tests
HOST=localhost DOMSUF=localdomain USE_64=1 DIST=/workspaces/nss-dev/dist \
  GTESTFILTER="TestSuiteName.TestCaseName" bash ssl_gtests/ssl_gtests.sh
```
For other gtest suites, use the appropriate script under `nss/tests/`.

**Expected outcome**: New test cases should FAIL here (they test the bug being fixed). Record whether each test case failed as expected or unexpectedly passed.

---

## Phase 3: Apply the Patch

```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
git apply --check /path/to/patch   # dry run first
git apply /path/to/patch
```

If `git apply` fails, try `patch -p1 < /path/to/patch`. Record any apply errors or conflicts.

---

## Phase 4: clang-format Check

Check that all modified C/C++ source files in the patch conform to NSS formatting rules. Run the project's own format script against the directories containing changed files, then inspect the diff.

```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss

# Run clang-format in-place on the directories that contain changed files,
# then use git diff to see any formatting violations.
bash automation/clang-format/run_clang_format.sh <dir1> [dir2 ...]
```

The script exits non-zero and prints the diff if any file needed reformatting. Record any violations (file name + line range is sufficient). Then restore the tree to a clean state before building:

```sh
git restore .
```

---

## Phase 5: Build and Test (UBSan + ASan combined)

UBSan and ASan can be enabled together in a single build. Build once, run the relevant tests once, and record results for both sanitizers.

The relevant tests are those identified in Phase 1; for ssl_gtest use a `GTESTFILTER`, for other suites use the appropriate script under `nss/tests/`.

**Build with both sanitizers:**
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
./build.sh -c --ubsan --asan 2>&1 | tail -30
```
Record: build success/failure, any warnings in changed files.

**Run relevant tests:**

Expected: all tests pass, including any new test cases that failed in Phase 2. Record any UBSan errors (undefined behaviour reports) and ASan errors (heap/stack overflow, use-after-free, etc.) that appear in the test output.

After testing, restore a clean standard build for the remaining phases:
```sh
./build.sh -c 2>&1 | tail -20
```

---

## Phase 6: ABI Check

Check that the patch does not introduce unexpected ABI changes in the NSS shared libraries.

This phase requires `abidiff` (from the `abigail-tools` package). Check availability first:
```sh
which abidiff || echo "abidiff not found — install with: sudo apt-get install -y abigail-tools"
```
If unavailable and cannot be installed, skip this phase and note it in the summary.

**Step 1 — Save patched build artefacts.**
The standard build from Phase 5 is the "new" dist. Copy the shared libraries to a temporary location:
```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/nss-abi-new
cp /workspaces/nss-dev/dist/*/lib/lib*.so /tmp/nss-abi-new/
cp -r /workspaces/nss-dev/dist/public /tmp/nss-abi-new/
```

**Step 2 — Build the baseline.**
Temporarily remove the patch, build, save artefacts, then reapply:
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
git stash          # remove patch temporarily
./build.sh -c 2>&1 | tail -20
mkdir -p /tmp/nss-abi-old
cp /workspaces/nss-dev/dist/*/lib/lib*.so /tmp/nss-abi-old/
cp -r /workspaces/nss-dev/dist/public /tmp/nss-abi-old/
git stash pop      # restore patch
./build.sh -c 2>&1 | tail -10   # restore patched dist
```

**Step 3 — Run abidiff for each shared library and compare against expected reports.**
The expected reports live in `nss/automation/abi-check/expected-report-<SO>.txt`. Any difference not already listed there is a new unexpected ABI change.

```sh
ALL_SOs="libfreebl3.so libfreeblpriv3.so libnspr4.so libnss3.so libnssckbi.so libnsssysinit.so libnssutil3.so libplc4.so libplds4.so libsmime3.so libsoftokn3.so libssl3.so"
for SO in $ALL_SOs; do
  [ -f /tmp/nss-abi-old/$SO ] || continue
  abidiff --hd1 /tmp/nss-abi-new/public --hd2 /tmp/nss-abi-new/public \
          /tmp/nss-abi-old/$SO /tmp/nss-abi-new/$SO \
    | grep -v "^Functions changes summary:" \
    | grep -v "^Variables changes summary:" \
    | sed 's/__anonymous_enum__[0-9]*/__anonymous_enum__/g' \
    > /tmp/nss-abi-report-$SO.txt
  diff -wB /workspaces/nss-dev/nss/automation/abi-check/expected-report-$SO.txt \
           /tmp/nss-abi-report-$SO.txt \
    && echo "$SO: OK" || echo "$SO: UNEXPECTED ABI CHANGES — see /tmp/nss-abi-report-$SO.txt"
done
```

Record: which libraries (if any) showed unexpected ABI changes, and a brief description of what changed.

---

## Phase 7: Fuzzing (Brief)

Only run fuzzers identified as relevant in Phase 1. Skip this phase if no relevant fuzzers were identified.

Build with fuzzing support:
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
./build.sh --fuzz 2>&1 | tail -20
```

The fuzz binary is at `../dist/bin/nssfuzz` or similar. For each relevant fuzzer target, run for 30 seconds:
```sh
FUZZER_TARGET=<target>   # e.g. tls_client, tls_server, asn1, quickder, pkcs12
../dist/bin/nssfuzz $FUZZER_TARGET -max_total_time=30 -artifact_prefix=/tmp/fuzz-$FUZZER_TARGET- 2>&1 | tail -10
```

Record: any crashes or timeouts found. Note the exec/s rate as a sanity check that the fuzzer is running.

---

## Phase 8: Coverage Check

Build with coverage instrumentation and run the relevant tests to check that the new/changed code paths are exercised.

```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss
./build.sh --clang --coverage 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Run the relevant tests, then generate a coverage report focused on the changed files:
```sh
cd /workspaces/nss-dev/nss/tests
HOST=localhost DOMSUF=localdomain USE_64=1 DIST=/workspaces/nss-dev/dist bash ssl_gtests/ssl_gtests.sh
```

Use `llvm-cov` or `lcov` to get line coverage for the specific files changed in the patch. Report percentage coverage and any uncovered lines that seem like they should be tested.

---
