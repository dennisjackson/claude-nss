# NSS Bug Summary

Read the current state of every active bug in `/workspaces/nss-dev/bugs/` and produce a concise status dashboard.

## Step 1: Discover all bugs

Find all active bug directories

```sh
ls -d /workspaces/nss-dev/bugs/[0-9]*/ 2>/dev/null
```

Skip any bugs in `bugs/finished/` — they are done and need no further action. Only process active bugs (directly under `bugs/`).

## Step 2: For each bug, gather state

**IMPORTANT: Do all data gathering yourself using Read, Glob, Grep, and Bash tools directly. Do NOT delegate per-bug research to subagents — they may miss files or report incorrect results.**

For each bug directory:
1. Read `input/bug.md` — extract the bug title/summary (first heading or title field). This is the one-line description.
2. Read `LOG.md` — the full log. The **last entry** is the current state.
3. List reports that exist:
   ```sh
   ls /workspaces/nss-dev/bugs/BUGDIR/reports/ 2>/dev/null
   ```
4. Check if `input/` exists and has content:
   ```sh
   ls /workspaces/nss-dev/bugs/BUGDIR/input/ 2>/dev/null
   ```
5. Check if any exchange branches exist for this bug number:
   ```sh
   git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/.nss-exchange.git branch --list "*BUGNUM*" 2>/dev/null
   ```
6. Check if any worktrees exist for this bug:
   ```sh
   git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/nss worktree list | grep -i "BUGNUM" 2>/dev/null
   ```

You can batch the `ls` and `git` commands for all bugs in parallel to be efficient.


## Step 2b: Survey worktrees

List all git worktrees and non-infrastructure contents of `/workspaces/nss-dev/worktrees/`:

```sh
git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/nss worktree list 2>/dev/null
ls /workspaces/nss-dev/worktrees/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each worktree directory that is an actual git worktree (not `nspr`, `dist`, or `tests_results`):
1. Check if it has a branch or is detached:
   ```sh
   git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/worktrees/<name> branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. Get the top commits (just the ones above trunk):
   ```sh
   git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/worktrees/<name> log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null
   ```
3. Check for uncommitted changes:
   ```sh
   git -C /workspaces/nss-dev/worktrees/<name> status --short 2>/dev/null
   ```

Include a **Worktrees** section in the output (after the Active Bugs table) listing each worktree with: name, branch (or "detached"), number of commits above trunk, whether it has uncommitted changes, and which bug it relates to (if any). Flag worktrees for finished bugs as candidates for cleanup. Example format:

```
## Worktrees

| Worktree | Branch | Commits | Dirty | Related Bug | Note |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|-------------|------|
| fix-2029323 | detached | 2 | no | 2029323 (finished) | Can be removed |
| my-feature | bug-NNN-foo | 0 | yes (3 files) | NNN | Work in progress |
```

## Step 3: Sanity checks

For each active bug, flag issues:
- **Missing LOG.md** — every bug should have one after fetch.
- **Missing input/** — bug data not fetched?
- **Log mentions triage but no `reports/triage-report.md`** — report may have failed or been deleted.
- **Log mentions bugfix but no `reports/bugfix-report.md`** — same.
- **Worktree exists but no commits on an exchange branch** — work in progress, not yet delivered.
- **Exchange branch exists but no log entry about it** — log may be stale.

## Step 4: Infer stage and recommend next step

For each bug, determine its workflow stage from the log and available artifacts:

| Stage | Indicators | Recommended next step |
|---|---|---|
| **fetched** | Has `input/`, no triage report, log only shows fetch | Run `/nss-triage` |
| **triaged** | Has `reports/triage-report.md`, log has triage entry | Human reviews triage, then run analysis or `/nss-bugfix` |
| **fix-in-progress** | Worktree exists, no exchange branch yet | Continue work in worktree |
| **patch-ready** | Exchange branch exists | Human reviews: `host-tools/sync-host-nss.sh` on host |
| **reviewed** | Has `reports/review.md` or log mentions review | Address review feedback or finalize |

If the stage is ambiguous, say so and explain what's unclear.

## Step 5: Output

Print a summary table, then details for any bugs with warnings. Format:

```
## Active Bugs

| Bug | Description | Severity | Stage | Last Activity | Next Step |
|-----|-------------|----------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| ... | ...         | ...      | ...   | ...           | ...       |

## Finished: [N] bugs in finished/

## Warnings

- Bug NNNNN: [warning message]
```

- **Severity** comes from the triage report or log entry (e.g., "High", "sec-moderate"). Write "untriaged" if no triage has been done.
- **Last Activity** is the timestamp and short description from the last LOG.md entry.
- Keep the output concise. Don't reproduce full log contents — just the last entry and the recommendation.
